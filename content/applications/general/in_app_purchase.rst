=====================
In-App Purchase (IAP)
=====================

In-App Purchases (IAP) are optional services that enhance Odoo databases. For example, the **SMS**
service sends text messages to contacts directly from the database, and the **Documents
Digitization** service digitizes scanned or PDF vendor bills, expenses, and resumes with optical
character recognition (OCR) and Artificial Intelligence.

IAP services do not need to be configured or set up, but each service requires its own prepaid
credits. Odoo users receive free credits to test out each IAP service, but need to :ref:`buy more
<Buy credits>` to keep using them. Each service has its own pricing and pack options listed on the
`Odoo IAP website <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services>`_.

Using services
--------------

IAP services are automatically integrated with Odoo, and do not require users to configure any
settings. To use a service, simply interact with it wherever it appears in the database.

.. example::
   The SMS service can be used on any contact that contains a phone number.

   #. Go to the contact's record.
   #. Hover the mouse over the space to the right of the phone number until a :guilabel:`SMS üì±
      (phone)` icon appears.
   #. Click the :guilabel:`SMS üì± (phone)` icon.
   #. In the :guilabel:`Send SMS Text Message` pop-up that appears, type a message and click
      :guilabel:`Send SMS`. Odoo will send the message via SMS and log what was sent in the chatter.

   The prepaid credits for the SMS service are automatically deducted from the existing pool. If
   there are not enough credits to send the message, Odoo will prompt the purchase of additional
   credits.

For more information on how to use each service, review the documentation below:

IAP credits
===========

Every time an IAP service is used, the prepaid credits for that service are spent. Odoo prompts the
purchase of more credits when there are not enough credits to continue using the service. Email
alerts can also be set up for when :ref:`credits are low <in_app_purchase/low-credits>`.

Credits are purchased in "packs" from the `Odoo IAP website
<https://iap.odoo.com/iap/all-in-app-services>`_, and pricing is specific to each service.

.. example::
   The `SMS service <https://iap.odoo.com/iap/in-app-services/1>`_ has four packs available for
   purchase, in denominations of:

   - **10** credits
   - **100** credits
   - **500** credits
   - **1,000** credits

   The number of credits consumed depends on the length of the SMS and the country of destination.
