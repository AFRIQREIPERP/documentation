====================================
Get organized by planning activities
====================================
Activities help colleagues work together more effectively by minimizing the chance of something
being overlooked or work being duplicated by multiple people. Plus, replacing emails or phone
calls with activities reduces the time spent communicating and improves the visibility of the work
being done.

Access and manage activities
============================
To access and manage activities, click on the :guilabel:`Clock Icon` along the top of any Odoo app to open the
:guilabel:`Activities` menu.

Recommended next activities

Odoo helps plan a series of activities by suggesting *Recommended Next Activities*.
