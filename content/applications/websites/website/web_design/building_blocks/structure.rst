Below are presented two types of structure blocks: :ref:`Banner <structure/banner>` and
:ref:`Masonry <structure/masonry>`.

.. _structure/banner:

Banner block
------------

The :guilabel:`Banner` block combines a title, text, images, and a call to action button, making it
suitable for placement at the top of a website.

Call to action

The call to action button encourages visitors to take a specific action, for example, consulting
your shop, downloading a file, or making an appointment.
