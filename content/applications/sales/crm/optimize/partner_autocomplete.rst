.. tip::
  Company data can also be generated by entering a :abbr:`VAT (Value Added Tax)` number instead of a
  company name.

Pricing
=======

Partner autocomplete is an *In-App Purchase (IAP)* service, and requires credits for each use.

.. note::
   If there are no more credits available, the only information populated when clicking on the
   suggested company is the website link, and the logo.
