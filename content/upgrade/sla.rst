=============================
Service-level agreement (SLA)
=============================

With Odoo Enterprise, upgrading a database to the most recent version of Odoo is **free**, including
any support required to rectify potential discrepancies in the upgraded database.

Information about the upgrade services included in the Enterprise Licence is available in the
:ref:`Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement <upgrade>`. However, this section clarifies what
upgrade services you can expect.

Upgrade services covered by the SLA
-----------------------------------

Databases hosted on Odoo's cloud platforms (Odoo Online and Odoo.sh) or self-hosted (On-Premise) can
benefit from upgrade services at all times for:

- the upgrade of all **standard applications**;
- the upgrade of all **customizations created with the Studio app**, as long as Studio is still installed and the respective subscription is still active; and
- the upgrade of all **developments and customizations covered by a maintenance of customizations subscription**.

Upgrade services are limited to the technical conversion and adaptation of a database (standard
modules and data) to make it compatible with the version targeted by the upgrade.

Upgrade services not covered by the SLA
---------------------------------------

The following upgrade-related services are **not** included:

- the **cleaning** of pre-existing data and configurations while upgrading;
- the upgrade of **custom modules created in-house or by third parties**, including Odoo partners;
- lines of **code added to standard modules**, i.e., customizations created outside the Studio app, code entered manually, and :ref:`automated actions using Python code <studio/automated-actions/action>`; and
- **training** on using the upgraded version's features and workflows.
