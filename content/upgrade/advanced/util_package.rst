====================
The *"util"* package
====================

Using Odoo's web client makes it relatively straightforward to navigate from your dashboard to the specific interface necessary for your business operations. However, achieving the same level of precision through code can be more complex. In reality, to make modifications to records, whether they pertain to your business data or are related to elements within your Odoo database, such as views, fields, and so on, you may find yourself needing to write several dozen lines of code to ensure that your changes are applied precisely to the targeted data and trigger all the re-computation and updates needed.

To simplify these tasks, we have recently released the *"util"* package alongside this documentation. This package contains a collection of valuable Python methods designed to perform high-level actions in a more generic and streamlined manner. With these methods, you can carry out various actions, including renaming a field in the database, relocating a field to another module, installing or upgrading a module, enforcing updates for "noupdate" data, recalculating fields, and more.
