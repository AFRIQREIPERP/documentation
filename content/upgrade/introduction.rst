What is an Upgrade ?
====================

TODO : maybe merge info from administration/upgrade into this page ?

What is an upgrade? : TODO put the rest of this page https://www.odoo.com/slides/slide/introduction-2705

Let's say you are digging into the files on your very old computer and you stumble onto a personal Microsoft Word document from years ago. You feel very nostalgic and try to open the file when suddenly ERROR, the file cannot be read ! Indeed, this file was written with the program Microsoft Word 2007 and we are now years later trying to open with Microsoft Word 2022, a lot of things changed between those 2 versions and,therefore, files written with the old version are not accessible with the newer version of the program, what a shame for your nostalgia !

Since there are also version changes in Odoo, databases developed and used in Odoo 12 might not be compatible when running them on a Odoo 16 server. However, thanks to our incredible framework, version changes comes with their additional lines of code specifically written to translate the data from the previous version to the next one. This means that for a huge proportion of our users, changing version is as simple as the click of a button, because all the changes between versions are known, and therefore are taking into consideration during the Upgrade process.

In a nutshell

TODO add the summary of AVG from knowledge
