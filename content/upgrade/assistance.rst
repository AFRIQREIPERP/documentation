    .. warning::
        If you choose another *Ticket type*, the request will be redirected to another team. This will slow down the processing and response time.

Please provide as much detail as you can (i.e., videos and screenshots to illustrate your issue).
This will avoid clarifying questions and speed up the resolution process significantly.
