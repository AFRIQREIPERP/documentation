- Answers to issues that you may encounter in your standard Odoo database (eg. “I cannot close my
  Point of Sale” or “I cannot find my sales KPIs?”)
- Questions related to your account, subscription, or billing
- Bug resolution (blocking issues or unexpected behavior not due to misconfiguration or
  customizations)

Ticket handling
===============

Tickets are handled via email communication and there will be no calls made to handle a ticket. Odoo
has an emergency support line `online support form <https://www.odoo.com/help>`__ for blocking
issues where tickets can be prioritized. Issues can also be prioritized through the Account Manager.

Tickets are received on a first-come-first-serve basis, in other words the oldest tickets are
handled first. Tickets will auto close if a response is not received back after Support replies
and seven days have passed.

Each ticket is reserved to handle one issue. This is so that if there are five issues, then five
Support Specialists will simultaneously take care of the tickets/issues as they are received.
