Upgrade
=======

These guides provide information on the upgrade process of your Odoo database as a whole, from planning and
allocating resources for an upgrade, all the way to the post-upgrade support

TODO added this that was from the old upgrade page

An upgrade does not cover:

* Changing :ref:`editions <upgrade-faq/editions-change>` (i.e., Community to Enterprise edition)
* Switching :ref:`hosting type <upgrade-faq/hosting-types-switch>` (i.e., On-Premise to Odoo Online
  or Odoo.sh)
* Migration from another ERP to Odoo
